## 🛡️ Security Engineer | 🎸 Rock Music Aficionado | 🎬 Classic Movie Buff

Welcome to my slice of GitHub! I'm a passionate Security Engineer with a knack for automation, scripting in Python, and a deep interest in cybersecurity. When I'm not securing systems or diving into code, you might find me at a security conference, either absorbing wisdom or sharing some of my own.

### What I Do

- 🔒 **Security Engineering & Automation:** Making systems impenetrable and automating the heck out of everything security-related.
- 🚀 **DevSecOps:** Integrating security practices within DevOps to ensure the safe delivery of code in today's fast-paced world.
- 🐍 **Python Scripting:** Automating tasks, building tools, and creating bots that make life easier and more interesting.
- 🛠️ **Incident Response:** Swiftly navigating the stormy seas of security incidents to bring systems back to safety.
- 🧑‍🏫 **Mentoring:** Guiding cyber security enthusiasts through the maze of threats and defenses, sharing knowledge, and building the next generation of security experts.

### My Hobbies

Apart from my professional endeavors, I have a deep appreciation for **classic movies** and **rock music**. These timeless classics and the raw energy of rock music keep me inspired and energized.

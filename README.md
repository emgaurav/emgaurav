# Hi there, I'm Gaurav Arora 👋

## 🛡️ Security Engineering Manager | 🎸 Rock Music Aficionado | 🎬 Classic Movie Buff

Welcome to my slice of GitHub! I'm a passionate Security Engineering Manager with over a decade of experience building enterprise security programs from the ground up. Currently spearheading cybersecurity at Zepto, I specialize in DevSecOps automation, cloud security architecture, and building scalable security platforms. When I'm not architecting security solutions or mentoring teams, you might find me at a security conference, either absorbing wisdom or sharing some of my own.

### What I Do

- 🏗️ **Security Architecture & Leadership:** Building enterprise security programs, leading high-performing teams, and establishing security-first cultures in fast-paced startups.
- ☁️ **Cloud Security:** Architecting secure, scalable solutions across AWS, GCP, and Azure with a focus on automation and DevSecOps integration.
- 🚀 **DevSecOps Platform Engineering:** Creating comprehensive security automation platforms that integrate SCA, SAST, secrets scanning, and vulnerability management.
- 🤖 **AI/ML Security:** Securing machine learning pipelines, building AI-powered security analytics, and protecting against adversarial attacks.
- 🐍 **Security Automation:** Python scripting, Lambda functions, and infrastructure-as-code to automate everything security-related.
- 🎯 **Incident Response & Threat Intelligence:** From DDoS mitigation to dark web monitoring, keeping organizations safe from evolving threats.
- 🧑‍🏫 **Community Involvement:** CFP review board member for B-Sides Vizag and OWASP Singapore chapter contributor.

### My Technical Playground

- **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, GCP, Azure security controls and architecture
- **Security Tools:** WAF automation, CSPM, container security, threat modeling
- **DevSecOps:** CI/CD security integration, vulnerability management, secrets management
- **Programming:** Python for security automation, Lambda Edge development, security analytics
- **Compliance:** PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, security maturity frameworks

### My Hobbies

Apart from my professional endeavors, I have a deep appreciation for **classic movies** and **rock music**. These timeless classics and the raw energy of rock music keep me inspired and energized. There's something about the storytelling in classic films and the authentic expression in rock that resonates with problem-solving in cybersecurity.
